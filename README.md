## 🔥 What I Do

### 🏗 Data Engineering & Pipelines
- Build **production-ready ETL/ELT pipelines** (SQL models, dbt-style structures, Delta Lake, workflow automation).  
- Design **clean staging → analytics layers** ensuring quality, consistency, and reproducibility.

### 📊 Analytics & Business Intelligence
- Develop decision-ready dashboards in **Tableau, Looker Studio, GA4**.  
- KPI engineering, experiment analysis, pricing insights, and cohort/retention modelling.

### 🤖 Machine Learning for Business
- Forecasting (energy, sales, inventory), classification, uplift analysis.  
- Experience with **XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, MLflow tracking**.

### 🧩 Experimentation & Causal Insights
- A/B testing frameworks  
- Uplift modelling  
- KPI diagnostics & profitability teardown
